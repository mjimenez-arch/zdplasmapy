# zdplasmapy Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic vision and planned development phases for the `zdplasmapy` suite. The goal is to evolve this project from a 0D solver into a comprehensive, interactive framework for state-to-state plasma chemistry research and exploration, with a core focus on scientific reproducibility and validation.

### Phase 1: The "Publication-Centric" Architecture Refactor

*Goal: To rebuild the project's foundation around a modular, data-driven, and publication-centric case structure. This is the most critical phase for long-term scalability.*

-   [ ] **Design the "Case" Structure:** Establish the "one folder per case" directory structure (`cases/chung_1999_o2_icp/`, etc.), where each folder contains the `config.yml`, `chemistry.dat`, and `experimental_data.csv`.
-   [ ] **Implement YAML + Jinja2 Config Loader:** Create the `config_loader.py` to parse the new `.yml` configuration files.
-   [ ] **Refactor to Data-Driven Chemistry:** Create the `chemistry_parser.py` to read the new `.dat` file format, including support for macros like `CO2(v=0..100)`.
-   [ ] **Create Modular Transport Library:** Create `transport_models.py` with self-contained classes for different physics models (e.g., `Chung1999_ICPCylindrical`). The `config.yml` will select which model to use.
-   [ ] **Refactor the `GlobalModel` Engine:** Update the core engine to work with this new configuration-driven workflow.

### Phase 2: High-Fidelity Physics & Interactive Tools

*Goal: To enhance the physical accuracy by coupling with a Boltzmann solver and to build the primary user interface for interactive exploration.*

-   [ ] **Develop `bifrost` (LoKI-B Wrapper):** Create the Python wrapper for the LoKI-B C++ executable.
-   [ ] **Implement Hybrid Solver Mode:** Upgrade the engine and chemistry format to support `LookupTable` rate coefficients generated by `bifrost`.
-   [ ] **Build the Interactive GUI (`app.py`):**
    -   Create a Streamlit app that browses and loads cases from the `cases/` directory.
    -   Implement the "real-time" run/pause simulator with sliders for key parameters.
    -   Display a comparison plot showing the simulation results against the `experimental_data.csv` for the selected case.

### Phase 3: Automated Science & Validation

*Goal: To automate large-scale data generation and create a rigorous, repeatable validation workflow.*

-   [ ] **Build Parametric Study Tool:** Create `run_study.py` that takes a base *case folder* as a template and runs it over a grid of parameters, saving results to a database.
-   [ ] **Implement Result Caching / Database:** Use SQLite to store all parametric study results, with logic to avoid re-running existing simulations.
-   [ ] **Implement Validation Workflow:** Create `validate.py` to automatically run a case, compare it to its `experimental_data.csv`, and quantify the validation error.

### Phase 4: The Intelligent Predictor

*Goal: To integrate machine learning for instant predictions and accelerated discovery, likely in a separate `plasma-surrogate-ai` repository.*

-   [ ] **Train a Surrogate ML Model:** Use the database of simulation results to train a neural network for instant steady-state predictions.
-   [ ] **Build "Ignition Domain Mapper":** Train an ML classification model to predict whether a set of initial conditions will lead to a stable plasma.
-   [ ] **Create the Ultimate GUI:** Integrate the ML models into the Streamlit app for real-time predictions and pre-flight warnings, with a "Verify with Full Model" button.
